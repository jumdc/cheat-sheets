# DL safety checks & basic learning steps 

## 1. small learning : making sure the networks learns propely 
- Train on a small part of the data
- Test on the same data
- Make sure it overfits and thus learn propely 

## 2. batch size
- large batch size leads to poor generalization 
- batch equals to the size of the dataset guarantees convergence to the global estima but very slow 
- smaller batch size have been empiracally shown to convergence towards good optimum
