## The key concepts 

- Search Space
The hyperparameters and their values that wished to be optimized.

- Search algorithm 

The search algorithm defines wich combination of HP are sampled from the __search space__ and how they
are sampled. 

> **grid search**  
a set of values for each parameter and the set of trials is formed by assembling every possible combination of values. 

> **random search**  
a variation of grid search, where you independently draw random values from a uniform density from the same configuration space as would be spanned by a grid search
